# ‚è≥ Predictions Wiki

## Overview

This website is live at https://predictions.wiki/

### What's the Purpose?

Well, the goal is to track predictions made by high-level people of planet earth, and then hold them
accountable to the public.

For a long time, people have made large, sweeping predictions over huge economic and world issues.
Then, when the predictions don't come true (or they partially come true and leave much to be
desired), people move on quickly and seem to forget about it.

This website aims to help change that, by tracking the prediction history and outcomes for various
statements.
