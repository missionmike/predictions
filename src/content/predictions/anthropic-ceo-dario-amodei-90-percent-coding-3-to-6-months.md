Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei stated that by September 2025, AI systems will be responsible for
generating 90% of all software code. He further indicated that by March 2026, nearly all code will
be produced by AI. Amodei noted that while the act of writing code will be largely automated, humans
will continue to play essential roles in areas such as software design, requirements specification,
and oversight of AI-generated code.

This projected transition outlines a shift in the software development process: from manual code
implementation to human-led planning, review, and validation of AI outputs. According to Amodei, the
role of developers will pivot toward supervising AI systems, ensuring code quality, and aligning
outputs with intended functionality and design specifications.
