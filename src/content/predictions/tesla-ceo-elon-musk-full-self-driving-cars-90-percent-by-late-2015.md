In a 2014 interview with CNN, Elon Musk stated that Tesla vehicles would be approximately 90%
capable of autopilot functionality by 2015. While Tesla did introduce its initial version of
Autopilot in October 2015, the system required active driver supervision and did not achieve fully
autonomous operation. The released software provided advanced driver-assistance features such as
lane centering, adaptive cruise control, and limited self-parking, but it did not meet the level of
autonomy suggested in Musk’s 2014 statement.

This marked the beginning of a recurring trend in which Musk made optimistic projections regarding
the timeline and capabilities of Tesla’s autonomous driving technology. As of 2025, Tesla's Full
Self-Driving (FSD) system—despite numerous updates and beta releases—continues to require human
supervision and has not achieved full autonomy.
