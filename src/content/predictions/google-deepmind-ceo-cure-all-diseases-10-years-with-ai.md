Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, has stated that artificial intelligence has the potential to cure
all diseases within the next decade. He attributes this possibility to AI’s ability to transform
drug development and biological research. According to Hassabis, AI systems could reduce the time
required to develop new drugs from several years to just a few weeks.

DeepMind has already contributed to this field through AlphaFold, an AI system that has predicted
the structures of more than 200 million proteins. This advancement provides researchers with
critical information about protein folding, which can significantly speed up the identification of
disease targets and the design of therapeutic interventions.

Despite this progress, experts and observers have emphasized the complexity of human diseases and
the necessity of rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approval before treatments can be
considered safe and effective. They caution against overestimating AI’s short-term capabilities,
highlighting that biomedical breakthroughs require more than computational predictions.
